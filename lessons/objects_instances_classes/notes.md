# Objects, Instances , and Classes

## Da Rules:

- File names: Class file names should be lower cased, if the name of the file is two or more words it should be separated by an underscore
    example: cell_phone.rb

## classes should start with the 'class' keyword, and end with the 'end' keyword
 - class names: should use UpperCamelCase
 - when creating an instance of a class from within a different file, you must first 'require in'
 - #<Dog:0x000000010310b658> (means instance object) 

 ## In a class, state is stored in instance variables that begin with am '@' sign.
    - Usaully these instances live in the 'initialized' method
    - instance variables can only be read from within the class
    - in order for instances vairiables to be read from outside the class , you need to create


# in classes behavior is repesented by methods
